Remove First and Last Character

//Problem
It's pretty straightforward. 
Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. 
You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
P-make a function that removes letters from a string
R-return a string after deleting the first and last letter or character
E- removeChar('place')==( 'lac');
P- use the function .slice method


//Solution
function removeChar(str) {
    return str.slice(1, -1);
  }
